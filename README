Setting up a Yocto Autobuilder Build Cluster
============================================

A lot of the autobuilder setup is individual to the circumstances of the
user. 

Files used for Yocto-Autobuilder Configuration
----------------------------------------------
Name: conf/autobuilder.conf 
Purpose:

This file is used to set autobuilder wide parameters, like where various build
artifacts are published to, as well as DL_DIR, or if build artifacts should be
published (needed for production autobuilders, not needed for desktop builders)
