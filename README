Setting up a Yocto Autobuilder Build Cluster
============================================

A lot of the autobuilder setup is individual to the circumstances of the
user. This document outlines some of the configuration options/files, 
autobuilder setup gotchas and general autobuilder best practices.

Setup
============

Setting the Yocto autobuilder up to run headless sanity tests

If you plan on using the yocto autobuilder to run sanity testing, you will need
to:

1. Install tight-vnc client and server.

2. Set up tap devs by running poky/scripts/runqemu-setup-tapdev

3. Add "xterm*vt100*geometry: 80x50+10+10" to .Xdefaults

4. Setup and start vnc session as the autobuilder user.

5. You MUST manually connect to the vnc session at least once prior to running
   a qemu sanity test (Something is getting set during the initial connection 
   that I haven't figured out yet. Manually connecting seems to set up the 
   session correctly.)


Settings
============

File: conf/autobuilder.conf settings

PublishSettings
---------------

PUBLISH_BUILDS:
Determins if build artifacts are copied into a release directory. Generally not
used for developer autobuilders, it's quite useful for production autobuilders.

PUBLISH_SOURCE_MIRROR:
If True, use BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1" in auto.conf

PUBLISH_SSTATE:
If True, use to sync sstate to sstate mirror

SSTATE_PUBLISH_DIR:
Directory LSB_SSTATE_DIR and SOURCE_SSTATE_DIR are copied to if 
PUBLISH_SSTATE = True

SOURCE_PUBLISH_DIR:
Directory sources are copied to if PUBLISH_SOURCE_MIRROR = True

BUILD_PUBLISH_DIR:
Directory build artifacts are copied to if PUBLISH_BUILDS = True

BuildSettings
-------------
SOURCE_DL_DIR:
autobuilder slave's DL_DIR

SOURCE_SSTATE_DIR: 
SState directory for non-lsb builds

LSB_SSTATE_DIR = "/tmp/yocto-autobuilder/lsb-sstate"
SState directory for lsb builds

Files used for Yocto-Autobuilder Configuration
----------------------------------------------
Name: conf/autobuilder.conf 
Purpose:
This file is used to set autobuilder wide parameters, like where various build
artifacts are published to, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR or if build artifacts should be
published (needed for production autobuilders, not needed for desktop builders)

Name: yocto-master/yoctoABConfig.py
Purpose:
This is the main yocto autobuilder config. Usually, there is no reason most end
users should modify this.
