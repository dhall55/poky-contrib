# META-WEB-KIOSK

The layer contains a new bitbake target, core-image-web-kiosk, that automatically
starts a Midori browser right after boot and enables the use of a virtual keyboard
if there is support for it.


# DEPENDENCIES

The layer depends on the Poky metadata. For further information, please visit 
the official Yocto Project website at:
	http://www.yoctoproject.org


# SETUP

Add the following line in poky/meta/classes/core-image.bbclass
PACKAGE_GROUP_x11-browser = "packagegroup-core-x11-browser"


# PROXY CONFIGURATIONS

If you are using the application inside a network that has proxy configuration,
uncomment the lines in the /recipes-browser/midori-session/midori-session_0.1.bb.
An example config file can be found in the files folder from recipes-browser/midori-session.


# CHANGE THE HOMEPAGE OF THE BROWSER

If you want to change the homepage for the browser, change -a parameter from
/recipes-browser/midori-session/files/midori-session file.


# ENABLE TOUCHSCREEN FOR qemux86

If you want to test the image using runqemu be sure that the variable HAVE_KEYBOARD
from poky/meta/recipes-bsb/formfactor/files/*arch*/machconfig is set to 0.
[Change *arch* keyword with the machine you are testing e.g if you use a x86 machine
*arch* will be qemux86]
