Meta-Hamradio Layer for Poky
----------------------------
Maintainer: Elizabeth 'KF7ESD' Flanagan <elizabeth.flanagan@intel.com>

HOWTO:
This is a typical poky layer, I've created to get my feet wet 
in creating poky layers and to play with ham stuff outside of work. 
In order to use it you should git clone the poky git tree and 
clone this layer into the tree. Modify your bblayers.conf to 
include this layer.

Keep in mind that this is a development tree and is unsupported 
and most likely not stable. Feature additions are pretty much at 
whatever my whim/interest/hardware is or via contrib (which is 
most certainly welcome!). Neither I nor my employeer nor the Yocto 
Project are responsible if any of this code doesn't work with your 
hardware, or does odd things with it (upto and including bricking 
hardware, melting your ham shack or causing poor QSOs).
