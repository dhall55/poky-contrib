meta-dlna
===========

This layer provides support for building a headless mediaserver which
supports the DLNA protocol via the Rygel Server and Tracker plugins

The meta-data for this layer is collected from the meta-guacamayo
layer using the combo-layer tools, the combo-layer.conf file show


Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on the Poky metadata. For more information on Poky see
the Yocto Project website:

http://www.yoctoproject.org.

The Denzil 7.0.1 (1.2.1) release  is required.



Maintenance
-----------

This layer is maintained by the Yocto Project. Send patches / pull requests
to yocto@yoctoproject.org with '[meta-dlna]' in the subject.



Building the meta-dlna layer
------------------------------

After you download meta-dlna, be sure to add its location to bblayers.conf.
Optionally, if you are building this for an x86 or x86-64 Virtual Machine,
you should consider adding the meta-kvm layer, which will enable the Virtio
and Paravirtualization drivers.

  /<path>/meta \
  /<path>/meta-yocto \
  /<path>/meta-dlna/meta-guacamayo \
  /<path>/meta-dlna/meta-kvm \

  "

You should then be able to build the image as such:

  $ . ./oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake guacamayo-image-mediaserver
