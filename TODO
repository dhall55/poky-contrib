  o Kernel (2.6.35, next)
  o U-boot (stable, next)

Basic layer plan:
For now we will be building linux-linaro-2.6.35.git/HEAD. Once working, we'll
look at adding linux-linaro-2.6.37 as a bleeding edge developer kernel. Per
discussions with Linaro developers, there is no need for us to package any
version other than 4.5 of GCC.gj

recipes-kernel:
	linux-linaro-2.6.35
	linux-linaro-2.6.37

Perhaps two layers are appropriate here?
	meta-linaro
	experimental/meta-linaro-next

Approach:
To build a linaro image, set MACHINE in local.conf to one of the machines
defined in the meta-linaro layer, ie beagleboard-linaro. Add meta-linaro to your
bblayers.conf, and build an appropriate image - such as poky-image-minimal.
