        <title>Board Support Packages (BSP) - Developer's Guide</title>

        <para>
            A Board Support Package (BSP) is a collection of information that
            defines how to support a particular hardware device, set of devices, or 
            hardware platform. 
            The BSP includes information about the hardware features 
            present on the device and kernel configuration information along with any 
            additional hardware drivers required.
            The BSP also lists any additional software 
            components required in addition to a generic Linux software stack for both 
            essential and optional platform features.
        </para>

        <para>
            This section (or document if you are reading the BSP Developer's Guide) defines
            a structure for these components
            so that BSPs follow a commonly understood layout.
            Providing a common form allows end-users to understand and become familiar 
            with the layout.  
            A common form also encourages standardization 
            of software support of hardware.
        </para>

        <note>
            The information here does not provide an example of how to create a BSP.
            For examples on how to create a BSP, see the

        </note>

        <para>
            The proposed format does have elements that are specific to the Yocto Project and 
            OpenEmbedded build systems. 
            It is intended that this information can be 
            used by other systems besides Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded and that it will be simple
            to extract information and convert it to other formats if required.
            Yocto Project, through its standard layers mechanism, can directly accept the format 
            described as a layer.
            The BSP captures all 
            the hardware-specific details in one place in a standard format, which is 
            useful for any person wishing to use the hardware platform regardless of 
            the build system they are using.
        </para>

        <para>
            The BSP specification does not include a build system or other tools -
            it is concerned with the hardware-specific components only. 
            At the end 
            distribution point you can ship the BSP combined with a build system
            and other tools. 
            However, it is important to maintain the distinction that these
            are separate components that happen to be combined in certain end products.
        </para>

        <section id="bsp-filelayout">
            <title>Example Filesystem Layout</title>

            <para>
                The BSP consists of a file structure inside a base directory, which uses the following 
                naming convention:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                "bsp_name" is a placeholder for the machine or platform name.
                Here are some example base directory names:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-emenlow
     meta-n450
     meta-beagleboard
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The base directory (<filename>meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;</filename>) is the root of the BSP layer.
                This root is what you add to the <filename>BBLAYERS</filename>
                variable in the <filename>build/conf/bblayers.conf</filename> file found in the 
                Yocto Project file's build directory.
                Adding the root allows the Yocto Project build system to recognize the BSP 
                definition and from it build an image.
                Here is an example:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBLAYERS = " \
        /usr/local/src/yocto/meta \
        /usr/local/src/yocto/meta-yocto \
        /usr/local/src/yocto/meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt; \
        "
                </literallayout>

                Below is the common form for the file structure inside a base directory.
                While you can use this basic form for the standard, realize that the actual structures
                for specific BSPs could differ. 

                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/

            <title>License Files</title>

            <para>
                You can find these files in the Yocto Project file's directory structure at:

                These optional files satisfy licensing requirements for the BSP.
                The type or types of files here can vary depending on the licensing requirements.
                For example, in the Crown Bay BSP all licensing requirements are handled with the 
                <filename>COPYING.MIT</filename> file.  
            </para>

            <para>
                Licensing files can be MIT, BSD, GPLv*, and so forth.
                These files are recommended for the BSP but are optional and totally up to the BSP developer.
            </para>
            </section>

            <section id="bsp-filelayout-readme">

                This file provides information on how to boot the live images that are optionally 
                included in the <filename>/binary</filename> directory.
                The <filename>README</filename> file also provides special information needed for 
                building the image.
            </para>

            <para>
                Technically speaking a <filename>README</filename> is optional but it is highly 
                recommended that every BSP has one.
            </para>
            </section>

            <section id="bsp-filelayout-binary">
            <title>Pre-built User Binaries</title>
            <para>

            </para>

            <para>
                This optional area contains useful pre-built kernels and user-space filesystem 
                images appropriate to the target system.
                This directory typically contains graphical (e.g. sato) and minimal live images 
                when the BSP tarball has been created and made available in the Yocto Project website. 
                You can use these kernels and images to get a system running and quickly get started 
                on development tasks.
            </para>

            <para> 
                The exact types of binaries present are highly hardware-dependent.
                However, a README file should be present in the BSP file structure that explains how to use 
                the kernels and images with the target hardware. 
                If pre-built binaries are present, source code to meet licensing requirements must also 
                be provided in some form.
            </para>
            </section>

            <section id='bsp-filelayout-layer'>
            <title>Layer Configuration File</title>

                You can find this file in the Yocto Project file's directory structure at:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/conf/layer.conf
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The <filename>conf/layer.conf</filename> file identifies the file structure as a Yocto 
                Project layer, identifies the  
                contents of the layer, and contains information about how Yocto Project should use it. 
                Generally, a standard boilerplate file such as the following works.
                In the following example you would replace "bsp" and "_bsp" with the actual name
                of the BSP (i.e. &lt;bsp_name&gt; from the example template).
            </para>

            <section id="bsp-filelayout-machine">

     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/conf/machine/*.conf
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                The machine files bind together all the information contained elsewhere
                in the BSP into a format that the Yocto Project build system can understand. 
                If the BSP supports multiple machines, multiple machine configuration files
                can be present. 
                These filenames correspond to the values to which users have set the 
                <filename>MACHINE</filename> variable.
            </para>

            <para>
                These files define things such as the kernel package to use
                (<filename>PREFERRED_PROVIDER</filename> of virtual/kernel), the hardware drivers to
                include in different types of images, any special software components
                that are needed, any bootloader information, and also any special image
                format requirements.
            </para>

            <para>
                At least one machine file is required for a BSP layer.
                However, you can supply more than one file.
                For example, in the Crown Bay BSP shown earlier in this section, the 
                <filename>conf/machine</filename> directory contains two configuration files:
                <filename>crownbay.conf</filename> and <filename>crownbay-noemgd.conf</filename>.
                The <filename>crownbay.conf</filename> file is used for the Crown Bay BSP
                that supports the <trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark> Embedded
                Media and Graphics Driver (<trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark>
                EMGD), while the <filename>crownbay-noemgd.conf</filename> file is used for the 
                Crown Bay BSP that does not support the <trademark class='registered'>Intel</trademark>
                EMGD.
            </para>

            <para>
                This directory could also contain shared hardware "tuning" definitions that are commonly used to
                pass specific optimization flags to the compiler. 
                An example is <filename>tune-atom.inc</filename>:
            </para>
            <para>
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BASE_PACKAGE_ARCH = "core2"
     TARGET_CC_ARCH = "-m32 -march=core2 -msse3 -mtune=generic -mfpmath=sse"

            </para>
            <para>
                This example defines a new package architecture called "core2" and uses the
                specified optimization flags, which are carefully chosen to give best
                performance on atom processors.
            </para>
            <para>
                The tune file would be included by the machine definition and can be
                contained in the BSP or referenced from one of the standard core set of
                files included with the Yocto Project.
            </para>
            <para>
                Both the base package architecture file and the tune file are optional for a BSP layer.

            <section id='bsp-filelayout-misc-recipes'>
            <title>Miscellaneous Recipe Files</title>
            <para>
                You can find these files in the Yocto Project file's directory structure at:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/recipes-bsp/*
                </literallayout> 
            </para>

            <para>
                This optional directory contains miscellaneous recipe files for the BSP.
                Most notably would be the formfactor files.
                For example, in the Crown Bay BSP there is the 
                <filename>formfactor_0.0.bbappend</filename> file, which is an append file used 
                to augment the recipe that starts the build.  
                Furthermore, there are machine-specific settings used during the build that are
                defined by the <filename>machconfig</filename> files.
                In the Crown Bay example, two <filename>machconfig</filename> files exist:
                one that supports the Intel EMGD and one that does not:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-crownbay/recipes-bsp/formfactor/formfactor/crownbay/machconfig

     meta-crownbay/recipes-bsp/formfactor/formfactor_0.0.bbappend
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <note><para>
                If a BSP does not have a formfactor entry, defaults are established according to
                the configuration script.

                You can find these files in the Yocto Project file's directory structure at:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/recipes-graphics/*

            <para>
                This optional directory contains recipes for the BSP if it has 
                special requirements for graphics support.
                All files that are needed for the BSP to support a display are kept here. 
                For example, the Crown Bay BSP contains the following files that support 
                building a BSP that supports and does not support the Intel EMGD:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-crownbay/recipes-graphics/xorg-xserver/emgd-driver-bin_1.6.bb
     meta-crownbay/recipes-graphics/xorg-xserver/xserver-xf86-config_0.1.bbappend
     meta-crownbay/recipes-graphics/xorg-xserver/xserver-xf86-config/crownbay/xorg.conf
     meta-crownbay/recipes-graphics/xorg-xserver/xserver-xf86-config/crownbay-noemgd/xorg.conf
                </literallayout>

            <section id='bsp-filelayout-kernel'>
            <title>Linux Kernel Configuration</title>
            <para>
                You can find these files in the Yocto Project file's directory structure at:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_*.bbappend
                </literallayout>
            </para>

            <para>
                These files append your specific changes to the kernel you are using.
            </para>
            <para>
                For your BSP, you typically want to use an existing Yocto Project kernel found in the 
                Yocto Project repository at <filename>meta/recipes-kernel/linux</filename>.
                You can append your specific changes to the kernel recipe by using a
                similarly named append file, which is located in the 
                <filename>meta-&lt;bsp_name&gt;/recipes-kernel/linux</filename> 
                directory.
            </para>
            <para>
                Suppose you use a BSP that uses the <filename>linux-yocto_3.0.bb</filename> kernel, 
                which is the preferred kernel to use for developing a new BSP using the Yocto Project.
                In other words, you have selected the kernel in your 
                <filename>&lt;bsp_name&gt;.conf</filename> file by adding the following statements:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel ?= "linux-yocto"
     PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "3.0%"
                </literallayout>
                You would use the <filename>linux-yocto_3.0.bbappend</filename> file to append 
                specific BSP settings to the kernel, thus configuring the kernel for your particular BSP.
            </para>
            <para>
                As an example, look at the existing Crown Bay BSP.
                The append file used is:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-crownbay/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_3.0.bbappend
                </literallayout>
                The file contains the following:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

     COMPATIBLE_MACHINE_crownbay = "crownbay"
     KMACHINE_crownbay  = "yocto/standard/crownbay"
     KERNEL_FEATURES_append_crownbay += " cfg/smp.scc"

     COMPATIBLE_MACHINE_crownbay-noemgd = "crownbay-noemgd"
     KMACHINE_crownbay-noemgd  = "yocto/standard/crownbay"
     KERNEL_FEATURES_append_crownbay-noemgd += " cfg/smp.scc"

     SRCREV_machine_pn-linux-yocto_crownbay ?= "6b4b9acde5fb0ff66ae58fa98274bfe631501499"
     SRCREV_meta_pn-linux-yocto_crownbay ?= "5b535279e61197cb194bb2dfceb8b7a04128387c"

     SRCREV_machine_pn-linux-yocto_crownbay-noemgd ?= "6b4b9acde5fb0ff66ae58fa98274bfe631501499"
     SRCREV_meta_pn-linux-yocto_crownbay-noemgd ?= "5b535279e61197cb194bb2dfceb8b7a04128387c"
                </literallayout>
                This append file contains statements used to support the Crown Bay BSP that both
                supports and does not support the Intel EMGD.
                If, for example, you were going to build the BSP that did not support Intel EMGD, 
                you would simply comment out or delete the statements that support building 
                Crown Bay with Intel EMGD support.
                So, the <filename>linux-yocto_3.0.bbappend</filename> could be as follows:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

     COMPATIBLE_MACHINE_crownbay = "crownbay"
     KMACHINE_crownbay  = "yocto/standard/crownbay"
     KERNEL_FEATURES_append_crownbay += " cfg/smp.scc"

     SRCREV_machine_pn-linux-yocto_crownbay ?= "6b4b9acde5fb0ff66ae58fa98274bfe631501499"
     SRCREV_meta_pn-linux-yocto_crownbay ?= "5b535279e61197cb194bb2dfceb8b7a04128387c"
                </literallayout>
                The append file defines "crownbay" as the compatible machine,
                defines the <filename>KMACHINE</filename>, points to some configuration fragments
                to use by setting the <filename>KERNEL_FEATURES</filename> variable, and then points
                to the specific commits in the Yocto Project files Git repository and the 
                <filename>meta</filename> Git repository branches to identify the exact kernel needed 
                to build the Crown Bay BSP.
            </para>
            <para>
                One thing missing in this particular BSP, which you will typically need when 
                developing a BSP, is the kernel configuration file (<filename>.config</filename>) for your BSP.
                When developing a BSP, you probably have a kernel configuration file or a set of kernel
                configuration files that, when taken together, define the kernel configuration for your BSP.
                You can accomplish this definition by putting the configurations in a file or a set of files 
                inside a directory located at the same level as your append file and having the same name 
                as the kernel.
                With all these conditions met simply reference those files in a 
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement in the append file.
            </para>
            <para>
                For example, suppose you had a set of configuration options in a file called 
                <filename>defconfig</filename>.  
                If you put that file inside a directory named 
                <filename>/linux-yocto</filename> and then added 
                a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement such as the following to the append file, 
                those configuration
                options will be picked up and applied when the kernel is built.
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRC_URI += "file://defconfig"
                </literallayout>
            </para>
            <para>
                As mentioned earlier, you can group related configurations into multiple files and 
                name them all in the <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement as well.
                For example, you could group separate configurations specifically for Ethernet and graphics
                into their own files and add those by using a <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statement like the 
                following in your append file:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRC_URI += "file://defconfig \
            file://eth.cfg \
            file://gfx.cfg"
                </literallayout>
            </para>
            <para>
                The <filename>FILESEXTRAPATHS</filename> variable is in boilerplate form here 
                in order to make it easy to do that.
                It basically allows those configuration files to be found by the build process.
            </para>
            <note>
                <para>
                Other methods exist to accomplish grouping and defining configuration options.
                For example, you could directly add configuration options to the Yocto kernel 
                <filename>meta</filename> branch for your BSP.
                The configuration options will likely end up in that location anyway if the BSP gets 
                added to the Yocto Project. 
                For information on how to add these configurations directly, see  
                <ulink url='http://yoctoproject.org/docs/1.1/kernel-manual/kernel-manual.html'>
                The Yocto Project Kernel Architecture and Use Manual</ulink>.</para>
                <para>
                In general, however, the Yocto Project maintainers take care of moving the 
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename>-specified 
                configuration options to the <filename>meta</filename> branch.
                Not only is it easier for BSP developers to not have to worry about putting those 
                configurations in the branch, but having the maintainers do it allows them to apply 
                'global' knowledge about the kinds of common configuration options multiple BSPs in 
                the tree are typically using.  
                This allows for promotion of common configurations into common features.</para>

            <title>BSP 'Click-Through' Licensing Procedure</title>

            <note> This section describes how
		click-through licensing is expected to work.
                Currently, this functionality is not yet implemented.
            </note>

            <para>
	      In some cases, a BSP contains separately licensed IP
	      (Intellectual Property) for a component that imposes
	      upon the user a requirement to accept the terms of a
	      'click-through' license.  
              Once the license is accepted the
	      Yocto Project build system can then build and include the
	      corresponding component in the final BSP image.  
              Some affected components might be essential to the normal
	      functioning of the system and have no 'free' replacement
	      (i.e. the resulting system would be non-functional
	      without them).
              On the other hand, other components might be simply
	      'good-to-have' or purely elective, or if essential
	      nonetheless have a 'free' (possibly less-capable)
	      version that could be used as a in the BSP recipe.
            </para>

            <para>
	      For cases where you can substitute something and still maintain functionality, 
              the Yocto Project website's  
              <ulink url='http://www.yoctoproject.org/download/all?keys=&amp;download_type=1&amp;download_version='>BSP Download Page</ulink> 
              makes available 'de-featured' BSPs that are completely free of any IP encumbrances.
              For these cases you can use the substitution directly and without any further licensing
              requirements.  
              If present, these fully 'de-featured' BSPs are named appropriately different 
              as compared to the names of the respective encumbered BSPs.
              If available, these substitutions are the simplest and most preferred options.
              This, of course, assumes the resulting functionality meets requirements.
            </para>

            <para>
	      If however, a non-encumbered version is unavailable or the 'free' version 
              would provide unsuitable functionality or quality, you can use 
              an encumbered version.  
            </para>

            <para>  
              Several methods exist within the Yocto Project build system to satisfy the licensing
	      requirements for an encumbered BSP.
              The following list describes them in preferential order:
            </para>

	    <orderedlist>
            <listitem>

		<para>
		  Get a license key (or keys) for the encumbered BSP by visiting 
                  a website and providing the name of the BSP and your email address
                  through a web form.
                </para>
 
		<para>
		  After agreeing to any applicable license terms, the
		  BSP key(s) will be immediately sent to the address
		  you gave and you can use them by specifying BSPKEY_&lt;keydomain&gt;
		  environment variables when building the image:
		</para>

		<literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ BSPKEY_&lt;keydomain&gt;=&lt;key&gt; bitbake core-image-sato
		</literallayout>

		<para>
		  These steps allow the encumbered image to be built
		  with no change at all to the normal build process.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Equivalently and probably more conveniently, a line
		  for each key can instead be put into the user's
		  <filename>local.conf</filename> file found in the Yocto Project file's
                  build directory.
		</para>

		<para>
		  The &lt;keydomain&gt; component of the
		  BSPKEY_&lt;keydomain&gt; is required because there
		  might be multiple licenses in effect for a given BSP.
                  In such cases, a given &lt;keydomain&gt; corresponds to
		  a particular license.  In order for an encumbered
		  BSP that encompasses multiple key domains to be built
		  successfully, a &lt;keydomain&gt; entry for each
		  applicable license must be present in <filename>local.conf</filename> or
		  supplied on the command-line.
		</para>
              </listitem> 
              <listitem>
		<para>
		  Do nothing - build as you normally would.
                  When a license is needed the build will stop and prompt you with instructions.
                  Follow the license prompts that originate from the
		  encumbered BSP.  
                  These prompts usually take the form of instructions
		  needed to manually fetch the encumbered package(s)
		  and md5 sums into the required directory 
                  (e.g. the <filename>yocto/build/downloads</filename>).
                  Once the manual package fetch has been
		  completed, restart the build to continue where
		  it left off.
                  During the build the prompt will not appear again since you have satisfied the 
                  requirement.
		</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
		<para>
		  Get a full-featured BSP recipe rather than a key.
                  You can do this by visiting the applicable BSP download page from the Yocto 
                  Project website at
                  <ulink url='http://yoctoproject.org/download/board-support-package-bsp-downloads'></ulink>.
		  BSP tarballs that have proprietary information can be downloaded after agreeing 
                  to licensing requirements as part of the download process. 
                  Obtaining the code this way allows you to build an encumbered image with 
                  no changes at all as compared to the normal build. 
                </para>
              </listitem>
	    </orderedlist>
	    <para>
	      Note that the third method is also the only option available
	      when downloading pre-compiled images generated from non-free BSPs.  
              Those images are likewise available at from the Yocto Project website.
