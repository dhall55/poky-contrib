<title>Common Development Models</title>

<para>
    [WRITERS NOTE: This chapter presents common development models within the Yocto Project.
    Reading this chapter will give the user a feel for the overall development process.  
    The chapter will follow the framework for the manual.  
    The team decided to present a single development model and not to try and represent all the 
    various possibilities that might exist.  
    The chapter will include an over-arching diagram that shows a simple, most-common development model.  
    The diagram will consist of boxes that represent high-level areas of the development process.  
    For example, a box for “Setting Up” will be in the model.  
    A box for “Debugging” will exist.  
    The diagram needs to account for the two use-cases we are going to showcase 
    (system development and application development)].
