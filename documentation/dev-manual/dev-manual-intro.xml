<title>The Yocto Project Development Manual</title>

<para>
    WRITER NOTE: The goal of this manual is to provide an over-arching development guide for using the Yocto Project.  
    The intent is to give the reader the “big picture” around development.  
    Much of the information in the manual will be detailed in other manuals.  
    For example, detailed information on Git, repositories and open-source in general can be found in many places.  
    Another example is getting set up to use the Yocto Project, which our Yocto Project Quick Start covers.  
    However, this manual needs to at least address it.  
    One might ask “What becomes of the Poky Reference Manual?”  
    This manual, over time, needs to develop into a pure reference manual where all procedural information 
    eventually ends up in an appropriate guide.   
    A good example of information perfect for the Poky Reference Manual is the appendix on variable 
    definitions (glossary).

        Welcome to the Yocto Project Development Guide!  
        This guide provides an over-arching view of the development process within the Yocto Project.  
        This guide is just that – a guide.  
        It helps you understand the bigger picture involving development using the Yocto Project.

    <title>What this Manual Does Not Provide</title>

    <para>
        This manual will not give you the following:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>Step-by-step instructions when these instructions exist in other Yocto 
                Project documentation.  
                For example, The Application Development Toolkit (ADT) User’s Guide contains detailed 
                instruction on how to obtain and configure the Eclipse Yocto Plug-in.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Reference material.  
                This type of material resides in an appropriate reference manual.

            <listitem><para>Detailed public information that is not specific to the Yocto Project.  
                For example, exhaustive information on how to use Git is better covered in the public
