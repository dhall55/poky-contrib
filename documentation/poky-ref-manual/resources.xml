    <para>
        Contributions to the Yocto Project are very welcome. 
        You should send patches to the Yocto Project mailing list along with a "signed-off-by:"
        line in the same style as required by the Linux kernel. 
        Adding this line signifies the developer has agreed to the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
        as follows:
        <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

     By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

     (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
         have the right to submit it under the open source license
         indicated in the file; or

     (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
         of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
         license and I have the right under that license to submit that
         work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
         by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
         permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
         in the file; or

     (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
         person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
         it.

     (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
         are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
         personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
         maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
         this project or the open source license(s) involved.

        A Poky contributions tree (<filename>poky-contrib</filename>, 
        <filename>git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky-contrib.git</filename>)
        exists for contributors to stage contributions.
        If people desire such access, please ask on the mailing list. 
        Usually, the Yocto Project team will grant access to anyone with a proven track 
        record of good patches.
