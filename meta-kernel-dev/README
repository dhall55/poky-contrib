meta-kernel-dev

What is it ?
------------

A gathering place for extensions to the linux-yocto (or really
any) kernel recipes that faciliate the creation and development
of kernel features, BSPs or configuration.

What does it do?
----------------

Currently this is mainly additions to the kernel recipes to:

  - Use a local clone vs a remote clone
  - Use AUTOREV to track the HEAD of branches vs a specific revision
  - Ensure that the $MACHINE is compatible with the yocto kernel
  - disables branch/revision checking
  - controls the naming of the linux build dirs via BB_LOCALCOUNT_OVERRIDE
    and LOCALCOUNT

What will be added to it ?
--------------------------

  - Tools specifically related to kernel development if they are
    unique and don't belong in the main layers.
